Presentation of the Paper: 《Universal adversarial perturbations》

URL：https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08401v3

This is the Python code and Dataset for my validation of the paper's experiments during the course. I used PyTorch and M1 device, and the root parameters are all fixed absolute path....so you may have problems to try to run it. (Don't run it, just skim it with my presentation's PPT)

In order to finish it, I refered to these works on GitHub: [GitHub - LTS4/universal](https://github.com/LTS4/universal)

[GitHub - qilong-zhang/Pytorch_Universal-adversarial-perturbation: A PyTorch implementation of universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) which is more easy to understand and implement.](https://github.com/qilong-zhang/Pytorch_Universal-adversarial-perturbation)
